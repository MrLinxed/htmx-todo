# htmx-todo
HTMX Demo / Learning Files

Small project with a fully functioning todo list app
- add todo item
- Mark item as completed (and mark as incomplete)
- Delete todo item

Fully utilizes the functionality of HTMX and uses no other libraries

Backend runs with ExpressJS and a sqlite database.
Rendering of templates is handled with nunjucks.
Runs on node.

Use nodemon if you want to work on it with file watching.

This project is obviously not production-ready and serves only to showcase the functionality of HTMX.
